                    <p style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">The Mu Mu Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. can trace its roots all the way back to 1983 where it began as a colony under the Kappa Chi Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. which consists of American, Catholic, Georgetown
                        and George Washington Universities respectively. During the years of 1983 through 1985, twelve young men were initiated into the fraternity under the Kappa Chi Colony. These men are considered the charter members of what later
                        became the Mu Mu Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.<br><br>The charter members of the Mu Mu Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. are Kelvin Holmes, Godfrey Eason, Rodney Dyer, Richard Nesbit, Terry Butler, Eric
                        Cevis, Allen Wolfe, Warren Green, Ric Wilson, Kelvin Coleman, Keith Chapman and Moyo Kasim. Brother Clarence F. Nelson Jr. was the Eastern Province Polemarch and presided over the chartering ceremony. These young men made an immediate
                        impact on the African-American community at George Mason University and were well respected by the faculty and their peers. These brothers were led by Brother Linwood Hardmon (Chapter Invisible, 1998), who served as the first Chapter
                        Advisor. We must also acknowledge Brother James Biff Carter (Chapter Invisible), Kappa Chi’s advisor along with the brothers of Alexandria-Fairfax Alumni as playing an integral part in the chartering of the chapter. </p>

                        year, the chapter had the honor to host the Eastern Province Council along with the Kappa Chi Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. and the Alexandria-Fairfax Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. in Alexandria,
                        Virginia.<br><br>The chapter has built itself quite a reputation over the past twenty years. Historically the chapter has been relatively small in numbers; however, the chapter remains one of the most visible and respected organizations
                        on the campus of George Mason University. Brothers have led and contributed to many programs that have enriched the social and academic climate of the university. </p>

                        as well as being the first fraternity to win Homecoming King repeatedly. Despite the chapter’s visibility socially the chapter has also excelled academically. Brothers have held the highest Grade Point Average (GPA) amongst all
                        fraternities at George Mason University for a consecutive number of years. Furthermore, the chapter is proud to acknowledge that we have over a 90% graduation rate, many of which have moved on to successful professional careers.

                    <p style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">The chapter has carved its own niche amongst some of the larger historical chapters in the fraternity, by being named Eastern Province Small Chapter of the Year from 1990 through 1994, and most recently in 1999, as well as the International
                        Small Chapter of the Year in 1991 and 1993 under the guidance of the current chapter advisor Ronaldo Nick Nicholson (Spr.80 Mu). The chapter has accomplished many great things over the past 15 years, and looks forward to continuing
                        the success of the past. The chapter will always remain true to the ideals of fraternity and its rich tradition of excellence and Achievement in every field of human endeavor as we move into the new millennium.<br></p>
